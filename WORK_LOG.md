| Sept 2 | 12:20-1pm  |                                                        I focused on writing out pseudocode to walk through my mental process of finding the fewest moves. |
| Sept 2 |  1-1:30pm  | Realized my approach doesn't accurately determine the smallest number of moves, also trying to figure out how to access the ladders and snakes correctly. |
| Sept 2 | 1:50-2:30  |                                                                                 Brainstorming a recursive approach - thinking broadly rather than coding. |
| Sept 4 | 10-10:45pm |                                                                   Read the reading passed out in class - didn't have time or energy to do any other work. |
| Sept 5 |  2:30-3pm  |                                                                                                 Worked on implementing the new strategy for Moksha Patam. |
| Sept 5 |  8-8:15pm  |                                                                                                           Tried to debug my problem and couldn't find it. |
| Sept 6 |  1-1:30pm  |                                                                                                            Debugged again and was able to pass all tests! |
