| Sept 2 | 12:20-1pm |                                                        I focused on writing out pseudocode to walk through my mental process of finding the fewest moves. |
| Sept 2 | 1-1:30pm  | Realized my approach doesn't accurately determine the smallest number of moves, also trying to figure out how to access the ladders and snakes correctly. |
| Sept 2 | 1:50-2:30 |                                                                                 Brainstorming a recursive approach - thinking broadly rather than coding. |
